<h2> Character</h2>
<div>
    <ul><b>Team RWBY</b>
       <li> Ruby Rose (Lindsay Jones) - The main character of the series, a young girl who wants to be a huntress. She is based on Little Red Riding Hood, has powers of speed, and wields a High Caliber Sniper Rifle/ Scythe known as "Crescent Rose"</li>
<li>Weiss Schnee (Kara Eberle) - The cold heiress to a big company, who still decided to fend off by herself by attending an academy away from her home. She is based on Snow White (which is even what her name means in German), has the hereditary Schnee Semblance wherein she is able to produce glyphs and can control them in more ways than one, and wields a Multi Action Dust Rapier called "Myrtenaster".</li>
        <li>Blake Belladonna (Arryn Zech) - A quiet and reserved Faunus who was previously a member of the White Fang. She is based on both Belle and the Beast from Beauty and the Beast, with her Semblance being the ability to project shadow copies of herself. Her weapon is the Variant Ballistic Chain Scythe known as "Gambol Shroud", a katana-like sword with a sharpened sheath with a pistol built into the handle, that can also be swung around like a kusarigama.</li>
<li>Yang Xiao Long (Barbara Dunkelman)- Ruby's older half-sister, a buxom and enthusiastic brawler. Based on Goldilocks, her Semblance allows her to enhance her strength based on the damage she takes (a change denoted by being surrounded in flames and having her eyes turn from lilac to red), and compliments her boxing fighting style with Dual Ranged Shot Gauntlets "Ember Celica" which extend along both her forearms from golden gauntlets.<li>
        <b>Team JNPR</b>
        <li>Jaune Arc (Miles Luna) - A student at Beacon Academy who still has much to learn, including his own special powers. He wields a hand-me-down sword from his great-great grandfather and a retractable shield, known as "Crocea Mors". Along with being a strategist and effective in basic combat, Jaune can use his Semblance to boost other people's Auras. His name is a reference to Joan of Arc, who joined the French army dressed as a male soldier.</li>
        <li>Nora Valkyrie (Samantha Ireland) - A highly energetic girl with a huge crush on her childhood friend and teammate, Lie Ren. Her Semblance allows her to absorb electricity without getting hurt and then releasing the stored energy to her opponents as she surges the power through her weapon of choice, a hammer with a built-in rocket launcher known as "Magnhild". Her character is inspired by Thor (who entered Jotunheim disguised as Freyja to retrieve his hammer), with the surname based on a fellow Norse myth, the Valkyries.</li>
<li>Pyrrha Nikos (Jen Brown) - A highly skilled yet socially insecure warrior. Her Semblance is polarity, which allows her to control metal objects at her own will. She wields an orange red spear-like weapon that transforms into a rifle ("Miló") and a shield ("Akoúo"). Her name is derived from Greek mythology, namely a moniker given to Achilles as he was disguised as a woman.
    Lie Ren (Monty Oum\Neath Oum) - The quiet and stoic childhood friend and teammate of Nora Valkyrie. His Semblance allows himself to protect himself from Grimm by masking any negative emotions that he could be feeling at the moment. His Semblance can also be shared with others if he performs either physical contact with them or if he is within their radius. He wields a pair of green pistols with blades attached to both ends known as "StormFlower". His character is based on Mulan (who joined the Chinese army pretending to be a man).</li></ul></div>
