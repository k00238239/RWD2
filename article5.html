<h2> monty Oum  </h2>
<div><p>Monyreak "Monty" Oum (June 22, 1981 – February 1, 2015) was an American web-based animator. He was known for his crossover fighting videos and was employed by Rooster Teeth Productions to animate for the web series Red vs. Blue and RWBY.

Oum attracted attention within the gaming community after releasing the hit video Haloid in 2007 on GameTrailers, which a Destructoid article called "the most interesting Halo-related fan movie in existence". The video has received more than 4 million views and is the most watched user-created content on the site. In October of the same year, he released the first video in his Dead Fantasy fan series which, like Haloid, featured fantastical combat sequences between characters from two different established games series (this time Dead or Alive and Final Fantasy). He released five episodes of Dead Fantasy, a preview of an additional episode and two music videos featuring the heroines of the series. After Oum announced that he had started working for Rooster Teeth, the series was put on hold.

Oum suffered a severe allergic reaction during a medical procedure and fell into a coma on January 22, 2015. He died on February 1, 2015..</p></div>
